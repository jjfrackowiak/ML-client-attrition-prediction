# ML-client-attrition-prediction
Repository dedicated to predicting client attrition with ML models. It has been developed as a final project for ML classes on Data Science and Business Analytics programme (Faculty of Economics, University of Warsaw)

The notebook contains all neccessary stages for classificaition models development:
1. Data Preprocessing (Encoding, Imputation, Feature Engineering, Scaling, EDA)
2. Cross Validation (Fine-tuning hyperparameters)
3. Fitting model to the training data
4. Calculating separate performance metrics on a hold-out test set 

4 types of classifiers were estimated:
- logistic regression
- SVM
- Decision Tree
- XGBoost
